Small cordova app allowing to write and save short texts

This project uses cordova / angularJS / bootstrap in order to propose a hybride app for writing short texts without requiering something as heavy as a text editor

It currently has been tested on a 1080p Windows 10 and a 720p Android Lollipop

It has been developped using Visual Studio 2015 - Community Edition
